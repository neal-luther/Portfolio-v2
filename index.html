			<p>My name is Neal. Thank you for taking interest in my work.  I am based in the mountains of North Idaho near the Canadian border, nestled up within 10 minutes of the local ski resort and lake.  The beauty and remoteness of my home inspires me to produce excellent work without the stresses of a big tech hub.</p>
      <p>Feel free to keep scrolling and reach out to chat!  Happy to discuss your project and my qualifications!</p>

			<h2>About me..</h2>
			<p>As someone that has over 10 years of corporate experience, include 5 years at the Enterprise level, I know time and resources are valuable. I am no stranger to working remote, as I have been without a full time office for over 4 years.  However, I have always believed teamwork and communication are the cornerstones to a successful project and working relationship, and I am 100% commited to being part of a team in any capacity, vitually or in-office! A few of my skills include:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>HTML/CSS</li>
         <li>Javascript</li>
         <li>Full Stack Development</li>
         <li>React</li>
         <li>Node</li>
         <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
      <p>If I am not coding, you can find me in the mountains with my family, snowboarding in the winter and mountain biking in the summer!</p>
